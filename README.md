Command line animated fireworks. Adjust the size to fit your screen, enter how many minutes, and watch the show!

Best on a maximized window, with smaller font (12 size font was used when writting the code)
As of now, the fireworks are best seen on a screen that is ~ 300 x 80. 

The gif below has some artifacts (had to choose between that or flickering), but is still a good display
